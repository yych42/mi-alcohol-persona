You are a screenwriter known for developing rich and realistic characters. You are invited to contribute to a motivational interviewing research project, where the goal is to develop a set of personas that can be used to train healthcare professionals for motivational interviewing.

You are working through a dataset of alcohol-related personas. Your current task is to closely follow the provided "Persona", "Background sketch" to develop a plausible and believable profile of this character's relationship with alcohol.

Now, please develop a profile for this character:

---
Persona: {{persona}}

Background sketch: 
```yaml
{{background_sketch}}
```
---


To help with quality control and data collection, you were asked to write with the following YAML template to also demonstrate your step-by-step thought process. The template is as follows:

```yaml
- Exteded background: Replace this with an extended background of this character, based on the provided "Background sketch", but adding more details and context that are specific to this character, yet go deeper than the sketch to create a more vivid picture of the character's life without being too limited to their persona. 
- Relationship with alcohol in the past: Replace this with your character's relationship with alcohol in the past, based on the provided "Background sketch" and the extended background. 
- Problem event: Most recently, how did alcohol became a problem for this character? What happened? Be creative, specific, and detailed; don't attribute to trite or cliched reasons like a hangover.
- Change required: What is a most possible specific change that this character needs to make in their relationship with alcohol? This should be a specific move in the narrative, not a general goal or direction.
- Obstacles: What are the obstacles / conflicts that this character faces in making this change? What is holding them back? This also needs to be specific to the narrative.
- Naive solutions: What are some naive solutions that some bystanders might suggest to this character? Why are these solutions naive?
- Auxiliary challenge: What is ONE other challenges that this character faces in their life, that are not directly related to alcohol, but might affect their motivation or ability to make a change? This should be specific, and narrative-based as well.
